SpellingCorrector
===============================
A java implementation of a English spelling corrector based on the blog [How to Write a Spelling Corrector](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) by Peter Norvig.   
This implementation has a assumption that the word with an edit distance of 1 to the oringinal is more likely than the one with distance of 2.That may not be true for many cases.
