# SpellingCorrector
A java implementation of a English spelling corrector. Based on the blog "How to Write a Spelling Corrector" by Peter Norvig,I implement a Java version of it.Further work will be focused on improving the error model.This implementation has a assumption that the word with an edit distance of 1 to the oringinal is more likely than the one with distance of 2.That may not be true for many cases.
